- Fields include date, amount, category (e.g., groceries, utilities, salary), description, and payment method.

#### Categorization
- Predefined categories for expenses and income.
- Ability for users to create custom categories.

#### Dashboard and Reporting
- Overview dashboard displaying recent transactions and current balance.
- Visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs for analyzing spending patterns.

#### Budgeting
- Set monthly or annual budgets for different categories.
- Alerts or notifications when nearing or exceeding budget limits.

#### Search and Filters
- Search transactions by date, category, amount, etc.
- Filter views to see transactions for specific periods or categories.

#### Data Export
- Export transaction data to formats like CSV or PDF for offline analysis.

### Advanced Features

#### Recurring Transactions
- Option to set up recurring transactions for regular expenses or income (e.g., rent, salary).

#### Multi-Currency Support
- Manage transactions in different currencies with real-time conversion rates.

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure the application is usable and visually appealing on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

#### Integration with Financial Institutions
- (Optional) Integrate with APIs from banks or financial services to automatically import transactions.

#### Notifications and Reminders
- Set reminders for upcoming bills or payments.

## Technical Considerations

### Database Design
- Use PostgreSQL to store user accounts, transactions, categories, and budgets.
- Design efficient tables and relationships to handle financial data.

### Backend Development
- Flask for creating RESTful API endpoints.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations.
- Implement authentication using Flask-Login or similar extensions.

### Frontend Development
- Streamlit for building the user interface.
- Utilize Streamlit's simplicity for rapid development and easy deployment.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for additional customization and styling.
- Use libraries like Chart.js for data visualization within Streamlit.

### Security
- Implement robust security measures, especially for handling financial data.
- Regularly update and patch any vulnerabilities.

### Testing
- Comprehensive testing, including unit tests and integration tests, to ensure reliability.

## Development Workflow
1. Planning: Define the application's scope, features, and user interface design.
2. Database Modeling: Design the database schema focusing on transaction data and user information.
3. Backend Development: Implement Flask for the RESTful API, utilizing Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
4. Frontend Development: Utilize Streamlit for creating a user-friendly interface.
5. Integration: Connect the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless data flow.
6. Testing: Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any issues.
7. User Feedback and Iteration: Test the application with real users and iterate based on feedback.
8. Deployment: Deploy the application on a suitable platform.
